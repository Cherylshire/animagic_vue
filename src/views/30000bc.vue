            <div>Okay!! Here is an interesting story! It's so bizarre!!!</div>
            <div>On September 12, 1940, the entrance to the Lascaux Cave was discovered by 18-year-old Marcel Ravidat when his dog, Robot, fell in a hole. Ravidat  returned to the scene with three friends, Jacques Marsal, Georges Agnel, and Simon Coencas. </div>
            <div>They entered the cave through a 15 metres (49 ft) deep shaft that they believed might be a legendary secret passage to the nearby Lascaux Manor. The teenagers discovered that the cave walls were covered with depictions of animals. Galleries that suggest continuity, context or simply represent a cavern were given names.</div>
