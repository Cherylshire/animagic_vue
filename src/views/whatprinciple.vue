            <div>The 12 principles of animation were first introduced by Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation, which was first released in 1981. In this book, Johnston and Thomas examine the work of leading Disney animators from the 1930s and onwards, and boil their approach down to 12 basic principles of animation.</div>

            <div>These principles form the basis of all animation work and are relevant for a number of different fields. The most obvious use is for animating a character, but these rules are also an invaluable guide in other areas, for example, if you want to introduce motion into your interface with some CSS animation.</div>
