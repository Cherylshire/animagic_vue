        <h1>Animation in the 19th Centery</h1>
        <div>
          <h2>
            <div>Continuing on from the early attempts of progect and making sequencing images moved.</div>
            <div>Before the 20th Century, early efforts to create a commercial cinema were undertaken by a number of artists, inventors, and photographers, the most well remembered of whom are the Lumiere brothers and Thomas Edison. They explored how a rapid succession of images could create the illusion of motion, make inanimate objects seem alive, or make one thing seem to magically transform into another. These early explorations into apparent motion blurred the line between scientific curiosity and popular entertainment, and animation has played with that fuzzy boundary ever since. </div>
            <div>Zoetrope</div>
            <div>A zoetrope is one of several pre-film animation devices that produce the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawings or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion. It was basically a cylindrical variation of the phénakisticope, suggested almost immediately after the stroboscopic discs were introduced in 1833. The definitive version, with easily replaceable picture strips, was introduced as a toy by Milton Bradley in 1866 and became very successful.</div>

            <div>Phenakistiscope</div>
            <div>The phénakisticope (better known as phenakistiscope or the later misspelling phenakistoscope) was the first widespread animation device that created a fluid illusion of motion. The phenakistiscope is regarded as one of the first forms of moving media entertainment that paved the way for the future motion picture and film industry. Like a GIF animation, it can only show a short continuous loop.</div>

            <div>Stroboscopic Effect</div>
            <div>The stroboscopic effect is a visual phenomenon caused by aliasing that occurs when continuous motion is represented by a series of short or instantaneous samples. It occurs when the view of a moving object is represented by a series of short samples as distinct from a continuous view, and the moving object is in rotational or other cyclic motion at a rate close to the sampling rate. It also accounts for the "wagon-wheel effect", so-called because in video, spoked wheels on horse-drawn wagons sometimes appear to be turning backwards.</div>
            <div>A strobe fountain, a stream of water droplets falling at regular intervals lit with a strobe light, is an example of the stroboscopic effect being applied to a cyclic motion that is not rotational. When viewed under normal light, this is a normal water fountain. When viewed under a strobe light with its frequency tuned to the rate at which the droplets fall, the droplets appear to be suspended in mid-air. Adjusting the strobe frequency can make the droplets seemingly move slowly up or down.</div>

            <div>Flip Books</div>
            <div>A flip book or flick book is a book with a series of pictures that vary gradually from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion. It is very easy to do and the cool thing is everyone and anyone can do it!</div>
