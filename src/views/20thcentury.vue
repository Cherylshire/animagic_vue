          <h2>
            <div>Animation starts to bloom in the early 20th century, reaching numerous milestones during the last 120 years. During the last century, we've unluck the secret to make the first 2D animated feature films and the first 3D computer generated feature films.</div>

            <div>1899 Arthur Melbourne Cooper's Matches: An Appeal featured stop-motion images of moving matches for a public service announcement made in England. It asked people to send matches (which were once somewhat expensive) to soldiers fighting in the Boer War.</div>

            <div>1900 James Stuart Blackton's The Enchanted Drawing was a stop-motion of Blackton making chalk drawings. 1905 Segundo de Chomón in Spain makes The Electric Hotel. It uses stop-motion to bring to life a variety of objects. It is far more ambitious than earlier stop-motion films. 1908 In France, Emile Cohl's Fantasmagorie uses cutouts and other techniques.</div>

            <div>Gertie the Dinosaur</div>
            <div>Gertie the Dinosaur was introduced in 1914, Winsor McCay premieres Gertie the Dinosaur in a vaudeville act. She becomes the first well known star designed for the screen. Hand colored details added to the film's appeal.</div>

            <div>1914-1915 John Randolph Bray and Earl Hurd are granted patents for animation systems using drawings on transparent celluloid sheets and a registration system that kept images steady. They form the Bray-Hurd Patent Company and collect royalties on the process until 1932 when the patents expire. Bray also develops the basic division of labor still used in animation studios (animators, assistants, layout artists, etc.). 1915 Max Fleischer receives a patent for the rotoscope. 1915 Willis O'Brien completes his first stop-motion film, The Dinosaur and the Missing Link. He goes on to direct stop-motion animation for The Lost World (1925) and King Kong (1933).</div>

            <div>The First Animated Feature Film (1917) </div>
            <div>El Apóstol (The Apostle) by an Italian artist working in Argentina, Quirino Cristiani, may have been the first animated feature. No print of the film exists and the only scholar, Giannalberto Bendazzi, who has researched the film says he is not certain the film was an animated feature (Giannalberto Bendazzi, Cartoons). It was released on 9 November 1917 in Argentina. This successful 70 minute satire utilized a cardboard cutout technique, reportedly with 58,000 frames at 14 frames per second. Cristiani's next feature Sin dejar rastros was released in 1918, but it received no press coverage and poor public attendance before it was confiscated by the police for diplomatic reasons. None of Cristiani's feature films survived. Bendazzi speculates it could have been animated or just a series of non-animated drawings. He also writes Cristiani directed Peludópolis (City of Peludo, a political satire), the world's first animated sound feature (1931-'33). The film was reported to have been an artistic, but not a financial, success.</div>
            <div><img src="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0007646/mediaviewer/rm2473867520">El Apóstol (The Apostle)</div>

            <div>1918 Winsor McCay's The Sinking of the Lusitania is the first serious re-enactment of a historical event. 1920 Bray Picture Corporation's The Debut of Thomas Cat was the first color cartoon. It was made using Brewster Color, a 2 color process.1921 Walt Disney animates his first film. It is a Newman Laugh-O-Gram sample reel. He sold a theater chain, headed by Frank L. Newman, on the idea of producing the series which included ads for local merchants.</div>
            <div>1921 Walther Ruttmann's Light Play, Opus 1 was the first non-objective (totally abstract) film shown to the public. It had a commercial tour with Ruttmann accompaning the 13 minute work on the cello. (Germany) 1923 Oskar Fischinger's first public screening was a showing of his Wax Experiments. (Germany) 1924 Max and Dave Fleischer's Mother Pin A Rose on Me, a Song Car-Tunes, was released by Arrow Film Corp. It was the first sound cartoon and it used the Lee DeForest Phonofilm sound process. 1926 Lotte Reiniger's Adventures of Prince Achmed, an animated feature using her silhouette technique, premieres in Berlin. It is the first animated feature that can be verified and prints of this charming work are still shown to the public on special occasions. 1927 Oskar Fischinger exhibits R-1, A Form Play using five 35mm movie projectors and a slide projector.</div>
            <div>Stramboat Willie</div>
            <div> Mickey Mouse makes his debut. Though the first Mickey Mouse cartoon is technically the six-minute short "Plane Crazy," the first Mickey Mouse short to be distributed is "Steamboat Willie," which is also the first Disney cartoon with synchronized sound.</div>
            <div>1928 Disney's Steamboat Willie wasn't the first sound cartoon, but it was the first to become a popular success with the public and critics.</div>

            <div>Władysław Starewicz</div>
            <div>Władysław Starewicz, a Russian stop-motion animator, notable as the author of the first puppet-animated film The Beautiful Leukanida (1912). He also used dead insects and other animals as protagonists of his films. Following the Russian Revolution Starevich settled in France. He has produced many films includes: Strekoza I Muravei (1913) – The Grasshopper and the Ant, Le Lion Devenu Vieux (1932) – The Old Lion, Fétiche Mascotte (1933) – The Mascot and many moer.</div>

            <div>1934 Disney's Playful Pluto demonstrates cartoon characters can express that they are thinking. Pluto is seen pondering a situation before he acts. In Disney's The Flying Mouse (also 1934), pathos is demonstrated eloquently. Both films demonstrate the studio's level of sophistication. The illusion of depth is first achieved by the Fleischers using table top animation in Poor Cinderella with Betty Boop. Ub Iwerks used his multiplane system in The Cave Man with Willie Whopper (1934). Disney's elaborate multiplane system is first seen in The Old Mill, 1937. 1935 Inker Sadie Bodin is fired from the Van Beuren Studio for union activities. She is the first to picket an animation studio. 1936 Len Lye's A Colour Box and Kaleidoscope (1936) are the oldest existing films made by hand painting directly onto film stock. Other artists had used the technique, but none of their work exists.</div>

            <div>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</div>
            <div>Development on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs began in early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature, to be released under Walt Disney Productions, to The New York Times. One evening that same year, Disney acted out the entire story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to his staff, announcing that the film would be produced as a feature-length film.</div>
            <div>Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Disney studio had been primarily involved in the production of animated short subjects in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series. Disney hoped to expand his studio's prestige and revenues by moving into features, and estimated that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs could be produced for a budget of US$250,000; this was ten times the budget of an average Silly Symphony. </div>
            <div>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was to be the first full-length cel animated feature in motion picture history, and as such Walt Disney had to fight to get the film produced. Both his brother and business partner Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it, and the Hollywood movie industry referred to the film derisively as "Disney's Folly" while it was in production. He had to mortgage his house to help finance the film's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of $1,488,422.74, a massive sum for a feature film in 1937.</div>

            <div>Through out the next decaded there were countless animation shorts and feature films. In entertainment use as well as political use. Examples can be seen in many.</div>

            <div>Animal Farm is a 1954 British-American animated drama film directed by John Halas and Joy Batchelor.

            <div>The US CIA paid for the filming, part of the American cultural offensive during the Cold War, and influenced the presentation of Orwell's ideas. The CIA initially funded Louis de Rochemont to begin work on a film version of Orwell's work, and he hired Halas & Batchelor, an animation firm in London that had made propaganda films for the British government.Maurice Denham provided the voice for all the animals in the film.</div>
