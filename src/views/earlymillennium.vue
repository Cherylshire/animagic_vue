                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">Through out the last 3 milleniums, countless sequence painting on vessels, objects were later discovered by archologists. Here is an introduction.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">The Yelda Khorsabad Court featuring the colossal Lamassu sculptural reliefs from Sargon II's palace, Dur Sharrukin, Iraq, around 705 BC</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubt able source.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">Dated back around 530 B.C. This amphora vase was part of the ancient Greek culture and was made by Terracotta with black-figure painting technology.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">The Euphiletos Painter was trained in the black-figure technique. It is interesting to compare the firm, deliberate incision in his works with the looser, freer line of artists like the Berlin Painter. The footrace is one of the earliest known events in the Panathenaic games.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">The longevity of the black-figure technique is indicated here by the ornament of the neck and especially by the animal frieze around the side of the lip. The horsemen ride along with an air of particular ease, conveyed not only by their seat but also by the exchange between them. They can be compared to the riders on the west frieze of the Parthenon.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">Date back around 430 B.C. This bowl is for mixing wine, and was part of the ancient Greek and Attic culture. Made by terracotta with red-figure.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">Da Vinci's Vitruve Man is how he study the human body proportion, this famous drawing can also be seen as movement. </p>
                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">This image demonstrates the blend of mathematics and art during the Renaissance and demonstrates Leonardo Da Vinci's deep understanding of proportion. In addition, this picture represents a cornerstone of Leonardo Da Vinci's attempts to relate man to nature. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online states, "Leonardo Da Vinci envisaged the great picture chart of the human body he had produced through his anatomical drawings and Vitruvian Man as a cosmografia del minor mondo (cosmography of the microcosm). He believed the workings of the human body to be an analogy for the workings of the universe." Dated 1490 AD.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">The magic lantern also known by its Latin name lanterna magica, is an early type of image projector employing pictures painted, printed or produced photographically on transparent plates (usually made of glass), one or more lenses, and a light source. The pictures shown were dated back to 1675 and 1720s. How incredible is that!</p>

                  <p class="text-muted mb-5">It was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes. It was increasingly applied to educational purposes during the 19th century. Since the late 19th century smaller versions were also mass-produced as a toy for children. The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century, when it was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35 mm photographic slides: the slide projector.</p>
