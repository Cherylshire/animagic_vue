          <h2>
            <div>Animation comes from the Latin words “anima,” which means “life,” and “animare” which means “to breathe life into”    Animation consists of still images (called “frames”) with slight differences between them. When viewed together in a sequence, they give the illusion of motion – like a flipbook.</div>

            <div>Movies and cartoon shows are what people tend to think of first, as they’re the most mainstream. Animation also encompasses:
