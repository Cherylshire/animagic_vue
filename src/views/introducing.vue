        <h1>The Disney's 9 Old Men</h1>
        <div>
          <h2>
            <div>Les Clark</div>
              <div>Started as an inbetweener (an artist who creates the drawings that appear in-between the extremes of an action that are drawn by an animator) on the 1928 landmark short Steamboat Willie. But Clark's true debut as an animator came in 1929 on the first Silly Symphony, The Skeleton Dance (in particular a scene of a skeleton playing the ribs of a bony buddy like a xylophone). He entered animation at a pivotal time and took part in events that shaped not only Disney's future but the history of the art form itself. Clark made contributions to all of the early classics - such as Fantasia and Dumbo - and later became a directing animator for features like Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan. After 48 years with Disney, Clark retired on September 30, 1975 - making him the longest continuously employed  member of Walt Disney Productions.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Wolfgang "Woolie" Reitherman.</div>
              <div> Born in Munich, Germany, Reitherman's family moved to America when he was very young. Originally wanting to become an engineer, his first Disney contributions included the shorts Funny Little Bunnies and The Wise Little Hen (Donald Duck's debut). During World War II, Reitherman left the Studio to enlist with the U.S. Air Force. He became an  ace pilot (serving in Africa, China, and the South Pacific) and earned the distinguished Flying Cross medal. After the war, he happily returned to Disney.</div>
              <div>At Disney Reitherman became known as the "action man," animating such classic showdowns as the dinosaur battle in Fantasia, the Monstro chase scene in Pinocchio, and the clash between Prince Phillip and Maleficient the Dragon in Sleeping Beauty. He went on to direct such classic as The Jungle Book and The Rescuers and produce such features as The AristoCats and The Fox and the Hound. In 1963, Reitherman became the first animator in the history of the company to be given the directorial reins of an entire animated feature, beginning with The Sword in the Stone. He retired in 1981 but passed suddenly only 4 years later at age 75.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Eric Larson</div>
              <div>Started as an assistant animator on the shorts The Tortoise and the Hare and Two-Gun Mickey. By 1940, he was an animation director and had designed Figaro the cat for Pinocchio. He also animated the horses and centaurs for the "Pastoral Symphony" sequence in Fantasia. Larson assisted Marc Davis in creating the title character of the 1950 Cinderella and animated Caterpillar for the 1951 Alice in Wonderland. But his most famous sequence, is the flight to Neverland in the 1953 Peter Pan. After Walt's death in 1966, Larson was placed in charge of finding and training new talent (along with animator Walt Stanchfield) - in addition to his character animating work (which ended as a consultant for the 1986 The Great Mouse Detective).Many well-known animators went through Larson's training program, including Brad Bird, Don Bluth, Tim Burton, Ron Clements, Andreas Deja, Glen Keane, and John Lasseter.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Ward Kimball</div>
              <div> Started as an inbetween artist on such shorts as Orphan's Benefit and The Goddess of Spring. But  he quickly became active in all areas - an animator & designer of Jiminy Cricket for Pinnochio, a producer for the television episodes Man in Space & Cosmic Capers, a writer & creator of the TV series The Mouse Factory, and directing animator of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. In 1948 he formed the Firehouse Five Plus Two, a Dixieland jazz band composed of fellow Disney employees. He also maintained a full-sized train and tracks at his home in California, and was a president of the Train Collectors Association. (Kimball is credited with helping and inspiring Walt Disney to install the Disneyland Railroad at Disneyland.) Kimball retired in 1972, but continued to do various projects on his own, and even returned to Disney to do some publicity tours.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Milt Kahl</div>
              <div>His earliest works include Mickey's Service Station and Mickey's Fire Brigade. Like the others, Kahl made contributions to all the early classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (animating the forest animals) and Ferdinand the Bull (for which he also lent his voice to). Often considered the finest draftsman and the best at drawing human figures of all the Disney animators, Kahl later became directing animator for Lady and the Tramp and Sleeping Beauty. His last work before retiring on April 30, 1976 - was as key animator for The Rescuers(1986)</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Frank Thomas</div>
              <div> Started out working on such shorts as Mickey's Circus and More Kittens. As a full-fledged animator, Thomas contributed to features such as Fantasia, Dumbo, Bambi, and Cinderella. He animated all 7 dwarfs in Snow White, the "I've Got No Strings" number in Pinocchio, and the pond skating sequence in Bambi. Like Reitherman, Thomas also enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in December 1942. He was discharged on January 23, 1946 and rehired at Disney on April 1, 1946. Now a premiere character animator, Thomas went on to serve as a directing animator for The Sword in the Stoneand The Jungle Book. Thomas was also a member of Kimball's Dixieland band Firehouse Five Plus Two, playing the piano. After retiring on January 31, 1978 Thomas and his best friend/fellow animator Ollie Johnston consulted on projects and wrote many books together - including the acclaimed The Illusion of Life.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Ollie Johnston</div>
              <div>He and fellow animator Frank Thomas had met as art students at Stanford University. He too began as an inbetweener on the shorts Mickey's Garden and Mickey's Rival. Johnston went on to contribute to all the early classics and eventually became directing animator for such features as Alice in Wonderland, Lady and the Tramp, and 101 Dalmatians. Like Kimball, Johnston's lifelong hobby was live steam trains. Starting in 1949, he built a 1" scale backyard railroad, with three 1/12th scale locomotives (later owned by his sons). This railroad was one of the inspirations for Walt Disney to build his own backyard railroad, which later inspired the building of the railroad in Disneyland. Ironically Johnston's wife, Marie, was also a Disney employee in the Ink and Paint Department. In the 1960s Ollie acquired and restored a full-size narrow-gauge Porter steam locomotive, which he named the "Marie E." Today it is owned by John Lasseter! Johnston retired on January 31, 1978 (along with Frank Thomas) and went on to write several books with Thomas (such as Too Funny For Words) and even lent his voice to the Disney/Pixar feature The Incredibles. Johnston was presented with a National Medal of Arts award by President George W. Bush and Laura Bush in 2005. The last living member of the Nine Old Men, he passed away in April 2008 in Washington.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>John Mitchell Lounsbery </div>
              <div>Was hired during attending the Art Center School of Design, an assistant animator on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. For the next several years, Lounsbery specialized in "Pluto" shorts, such as Pluto's Playmate, Pluto at the Zoo and Private Pluto. Lounsbery's later contributions included Honest John in Pinocchio, faithful Timothy the mouse in Dumbo and Tony the cook in Lady and the Tramp. During the war years, he worked on Victory Through Air Power, The Three Caballeros, and various propaganda shorts. He later served as directing animator on Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree and Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, which won an Academy Award. Lounsbery underrated himself and underplayed his talent - and so in turn was vastly underrated as an animator-director by many in the business. He humbly continued to animate (specifically on The Rescuers) until his death on February 13, 1976 - sadly making Lounsbery the first of Walt's Nine Old Men to pass.</div>
            <div>==========================</div>
            <div>Marc Fraser Davis</div>
              <div>Like Lounsbery, Davis too began as an apprentice animator on Snow White. He then moved on to story sketch and character design on Bambi and Victory Through Air Power. But his greatest contributions would be the creation of Disney's most memorable animated women - Cruella De Vil in 101 Dalmatians, Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty and Tinker Bell in Peter Pan. He  later transferred to Disney's design and development organization (today known as Walt Disney Imagineering). As one of Disney's original Imagineers, Davis contributed to such Disneyland attractions as the Enchanted Tiki Room, It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion and The Jungle Cruise. (His wife Alice Davis created the original costuming for figures in the Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a Small World.) After 43 years with Disney, Davis retired in 1978, but continued to lend his expertise to the development of EPCOT and Tokyo Disneyland. He passed away in January 2000 - the same month the Marc Frasier Davis Scholarship Fund was formally established at the California Institute of the Arts.</div>
